Silverfeelin's icon repo for Sky:CotL.

Please view the wiki article for icon guidelines. [Wiki Guidelines for Editing](https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Wiki_Guidelines_for_Editing).  
Icons in this repo use a 300x300 pixel viewbox and are designed for use on the wiki.

## Colors

Most icons use the same set of colors. Some icons include gradients and/or unique colors.  
The main set of colors per icon type can be found below.

### Spell icons

> Most spell icons use the primary and secondary colors even if the item uses different colors.

| Type | HEX | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | `#f9f0d4` | The main off-white color most icons use. |
| Secondary | `#c79290` | The pink accent color used for dual-tone icons. |

## Stroke

Icons typically have a single color stroke. The stroke has a fixed width and blur effect applied to it.  
Settings per application are as follows:

**Inkscape**

| Parameter | Value | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| Color | `3753f4b` | Some icons like capes have a unique stroke color. |
| Width | `12.3px` | |
| Blur % | `11.4%` | This percentage should be applied over the full canvas of 300x300px. An easy way to accomplish this is by selecting both the layer you want to blur and a rectangle that covers the full canvas. |

**Adobe Illustrator**

| Parameter | Value | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| Stroke | `12pt` | Use `Round Joint Corners` |
| Gaussian Blur | `2px` | |
