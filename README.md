## Stroke

Icons typically have a single color stroke. The stroke has a fixed width and blur effect applied to it.  
Settings per application are as follows:

**Inkscape**

| Parameter | Value | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| Color | `3753f4b` | Some icons like capes have a unique stroke color. |
| Width | `12.3px` | |
| Blur % | `11.4%` | This percentage should be applied over the full canvas of 300x300px. An easy way to accomplish this is by selecting both the layer you want to blur and a rectangle that covers the full canvas. |

**Adobe Illustrator**

| Parameter | Value | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| Stroke | `12pt` | Use `Round Joint Corners` |
| Gaussian Blur | `2px` | |
